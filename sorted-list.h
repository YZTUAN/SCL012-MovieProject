 * When your sorted list is used to store objects of some type, since the
 * type is opaque to you, you will need a comparator function to order
 * the objects in your sorted list.
 *
 * You can expect a comparator function to return -1 if the 1st object is
 * smaller, 0 if the two objects are equal, and 1 if the 2nd object is
 * smaller.
 *
 * Note that you are not expected to implement any comparator or destruct
 * functions.  You will be given a comparator function and a destruct
 * function when a new sorted list is created.
